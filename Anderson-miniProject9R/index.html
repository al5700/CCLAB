    <center>
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary,<br>
While I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious<br>
Volume of forgotten lore—<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping,<br>
Suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping,<br>
Rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered,<br>
"Tapping at my chamber door<br>
Only this, and nothing more."<br>
</p>

<p>Ah, distinctly I remember,<br>
It was in the bleak December,<br>
And each separate dying ember<br>
Wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;<br>
Vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow<br>
Sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden<br>
Whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
Nameless here for evermore<br>
</p>

<p>
  And the silken, sad, uncertain<br>
Rustling of each purple curtain<br>
Thrilled me,—filled me with fantastic<br>
Terrors, never felt before;<br>
So that now, to still the beating<br>
Of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
" 'Tis some visitor entreating<br>
Entrance at my chamber door<br>
Some late visitor entreating<br>
Entrance at my chamber door;<br>
This it is, and nothing more."<br>
</p>

<p>
  Presently my soul grew stronger;<br>
  Hesitating then no longer,<br>
  "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly<br>
  Your forgiveness I implore;<br>
  But the fact is I was napping,<br>
  And so gently you came rapping,<br>
  And so faintly you came tapping,<br>
  Tapping at my chamber door,<br>
  That I scarce was sure I heard you."—<br>
  Here I opened wide the door;<br>
  Darkness there, and nothing more.<br>
</p>

<p>
Deep into that darkness peering,<br>
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals<br>
Ever dared to dream before;<br>
But the silence was unbroken,<br>
And the stillness gave no token,<br>
And the only word there spoken<br>
Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br>
This I whispered, and an echo<br>
Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br>
Merely this, and nothing more.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Back into the chamber turning,<br>
  All my soul within me burning,<br>
  Soon again I heard a tapping,<br>
  Something louder than before.<br>
  "Surely," said I, "surely, that is<br>
  Something at my window lattice;<br>
  Let me see then, what thereat is,<br>
  And this mystery explore—<br>
  Let my heart be still a moment,<br>
  And this mystery explore;—<br>
  'Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br>
</p>

<p>
  Open here I flung the shutter.<br>
  When, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
  In there stepped a stately Raven<br>
  Of the saintly days of yore;<br>
  Not the least obeisance made he;<br>
  Not a minute stopped or stayed he,<br>
  But, with mien of lord or lady,<br>
  Perched above my chamber door—<br>
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas<br>
  Just above my chamber door—<br>
  Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then this ebony bird beguiling<br>
My sad fancy into smiling,<br>
By the grave and stern decorum<br>
Of the countenance it wore,<br>
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven,<br>
Thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,<br>
Wandering from the nightly shore,<br>
Tell me what thy lordly name is<br>
On the night's Plutonian shore!"<br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br>
</p>

<p>
  Much I marveled this ungainly<br>
  Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
  Though its answer little meaning—<br>
  Little relevancy bore;<br>
  For we can not help agreeing<br>
  That no living human being<br>
  Ever yet was blest with seeing<br>
  Bird above his chamber door—<br>
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured<br>
  Bust above his chamber door,<br>
  With such name as "Nevermore."<br>
</p>

<p>
  But the Raven, sitting lonely<br>
  On that placid bust, spoke only<br>
  That one word, as if his soul in<br>
  That one word he did outpour.<br>
  Nothing farther then he uttered,<br>
  Not a feather then he fluttered,<br>
  Till I scarcely more than muttered,<br>
  "Other friends have flown before—<br>
  On the morrow he will leave me,<br>
  As my Hopes have flown before."<br>
  Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br>
</p>

<p>
  Startled at the stillness broken<br>
  By reply so aptly spoken,<br>
  "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters<br>
  Is its only stock and store,<br>
  Caught from some unhappy master<br>
  Whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
  Followed fast and followed faster<br>
  Till his songs one burden bore—<br>
  Till the dirges of his Hope that<br>
  Melancholy burden bore<br>
  Of 'Never—nevermore.' "<br>
</p>

<p>
  But the Raven still beguiling<br>
  All my sad soul into smiling,<br>
  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in<br>
  Front of bird, and bust, and door;<br>
  Then, upon the velvet sinking,<br>
  I betook myself to linking<br>
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking<br>
  What this ominous bird of yore—<br>
  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly,<br>
  Gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
  Meant in croaking "Nevermore.<br>
</p>

<p>
  This I sat engaged in guessing,<br>
  But no syllable expressing<br>
  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now<br>
  Burned into my bosom's core;<br>
  This and more I sat divining,<br>
  With my head at ease reclining<br>
  On the cushion's velvet lining<br>
  That the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
  But whose velvet violet lining,<br>
  With the lamplight gloating o'er<br>
  She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>

</p>

<p>
  Then, methought, the air grew denser,<br>
  Perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
  Swung by Seraphim, whose footfalls<br>
  Tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
  "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee—<br>
  By these angels he hath sent thee<br>
  Respite—respite and nepenthe[1]<br>
  From thy memories of Lenore!<br>
  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe,<br>
  And forget this lost Lenore!"<br>
  Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br>
</p>


<p>
  Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—<br>
  Prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
  Whether Tempter sent, or whether<br>
  Tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
  Desolate, yet all undaunted,<br>
  On this desert land enchanted—<br>
  On this home by Horror haunted—<br>
  Tell me truly, I implore—<br>
  Is there—is there balm in Gilead?<br>
  Tell me—tell me, I implore!"<br>
  Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore.<br>
</p>

<p>
  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil,—<br>
  Prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
  By that heaven that bends above us,<br>
  By that God we both adore,<br>
  Tell this soul with sorrow laden,<br>
  If, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
  It shall clasp a sainted maiden<br>
  Whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden,<br>
  Whom the angels name Lenore."<br>
  Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br>
</p>

<p>
  "Be that word our sign of parting,<br>
  Bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting;<br>
  "Get thee back into the tempest<br>
  And the night's Plutonian shore!<br>
  Leave no black plume as a token<br>
  Of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
  Leave my loneliness unbroken!—<br>
  Quit the bust above my door!<br>
  Take thy beak from out my heart, and<br>
  Take thy form from off my door!"<br>
  Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br>
</p>

<p>
  And the Raven, never flitting,<br>
  Still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
  On the pallid bust of Pallas<br>
  Just above my chamber door;<br>
  And his eyes have all the seeming<br>
  Of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
  And the lamplight o'er him streaming<br>
  Throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
  And my soul from out that shadow,<br>
  That lies floating on the floor,<br>
  Shall be lifted—nevermore!<br>
